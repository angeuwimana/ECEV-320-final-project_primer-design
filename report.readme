# ECEV-320-final-project_primer-design

where you need to change: b value, path

1.Goal:

Import: plasmid DNA sequence, and the location of the start and end point of the DNA sequence of interest.
Import requirement: single-stranded DNA sequence in .txt file (nor space, tab, comma separated, all upper case)

Export: all possible primer combinations that meet certain rules.  


2.The primers generatd by the code meet the following standards along with the explaination:

  1) 40-60% G/C content:

  2) Melting temperature (Tm) of 50-60째C:

  3) 




3.General strategy outline:

  1. Import DNA sequence file (.txt format); (Chufan)
  2. Enter the location of the start and end point of the DNA sequence of interest. (Chufan)
  For example: enter 1650 and 1820; Figure out how to enumerate nucleotides into number#bp;
  3. The code generates all possible 18-24 bp length forward DNAs around the start point; (Chufan)
  4. The code generates all possible 18-24 bp length reverse DNAs around the end point. ( Chufan)
  5. Transform all 18-24 bp long DNA sequences into primer sequences: complementary. ( Chufan) 
  6. The code calculates several scores and gets rid of the unsuitable ones. (Emma)




Primer pairs should have a Tm within 5째C of each other


Make sure there are no highly repetitive sequences (maybe, it might be too hard) True, there are too many combinations
This can be added in the beginning. You can look at primer pairs and filter out those that have >4 repeats. 
Primer pairs should not have complementary regions (maybe, hard)True, there are too many combinations

  7. Return the primer list.


More complicated strategies if time allows:
1. Check complementary regions;
2. Pull sequence from Addgene website instead of directly feeding the code with DNA sequence;

Good primers definition:
Length of 18-24 bases
40-60% G/C content
Start and end with 1-2 G/C pairs
Melting temperature (Tm) of 50-60째C
Primer pairs should have a Tm within 5째C of each other


4.Limitations:

The program only finds out primers that must include the imputed starting point, or end point.
